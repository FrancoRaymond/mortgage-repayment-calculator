## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.


## The challenge

The challenge was to build out this mortgage repayment calculator and get it looking as close to the design as possible.


users are able to: 

- Input mortgage information and see monthly repayment and total repayment amounts after submitting the form
- See form validation messages if any field is incomplete
- Complete the form only using their keyboard
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
